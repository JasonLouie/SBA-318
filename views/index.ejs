                <h1>About the API</h1>
                <p>
                    This WebChatAPI was created to handle text chats between two
                    or more users and uses Node.js, Express, and EJS (to render
                    a view). At the moment, it is not connected to any databases
                    and uses static data. Any information created, updated, or
                    deleted will only take effect during the current instance
                    that the API is being ran (data does not persist). The
                    primary endpoint is the users endpoint and anything
                    implemented in this specific endpoint is expected to be
                    available for all users with an account. The chats and
                    messages endpoints are not meant for all users to access
                    (mainly administrators). For the scope of this project, some
                    methods are implemented and enabled. At the moment PATCH
                    requests do not account for providing data that should be
                    unique (changing a user's email) or ensuring that the new
                    data is different from the previous data. Below are tables
                    explaining the HTTP Responses, classes in this project, and
                    a code snippet with comments for static data.

                <p>

                            this counts as the user leaving the server.
